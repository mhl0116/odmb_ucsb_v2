V01-05: 29 September 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
Moved header ahead to avoid DDU timeouts.
Turn on all DCFEBs and ALCT on power on.
Fix issue with PCFIFO that would not send 21% of the packets.
Added PRBS test, and functionality to test all CCB signals.

V01-04: 11 September 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
Send ALCT/OTMB data through EOFGEN to fix shifted word.
Added FIFO_CASCADE, and applied to all large FIFOs.

V01-03: 20 August 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
Added SYSTEM_MON and BPI_PORT (the latter in progress).
Added pedestal mode that sends L1A_MATCHes for each L1A.
Synchonized the ALCT/OTMB data with ODMB clock.

V01-02: 13 August 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
Separated the optical and FW resets.
Fixed bugs in PCFIFO.

V01-01: 8 August 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
CONTROL does not remove the first 2 words of ALCT/OTMB packets.
Changed the write/read of registers to the same address.

V01-00: 7 August 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
Added ALCT and OTMB data to the DDU packets.
Fixed DAVs in CAFIFO and now use them in CONTROL to trigger packets.

V00-09: 3 August 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
Synchronized PCFIFO with the output clock, added an interframe gap,
and fixed a problem with packets that were too short.
Packets to the PC are fairly reliable now.

V00-08: 1 August 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
Separated the FW and optical resets.
Included L1A_CNT and BX_CNT resets coming from the CCB.

V00-07: 18 July 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
Added commands to send pulses to OTMB_LCT_RQST and OTMB_EXT_TRIG.
Changed signals sent to test points to include RAW_LCT.

V00-06: 15 July 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
Made hdlmacro into a library.
Removed FIFOMON, tfifos, and many other unsued variables.
Re-ordered components for easy viewing in ISE and ModelSim.

V00-05: 10 July 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
Arranged RAWLCT[0:7] according to the OTMB manual.

V00-04: 2 July 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
Fixed a pulldown on int_tms, and some cleaning.

V00-03: 1 July 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
Wrote new TX/RX for the GL0 and GL1, with their corresponding FIFOs.
Added a CRC counter to check the DCFEB transmission.

V00-02: 11 June 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
Made VMEMON easier to use.
Do not require correct L1A_COUNTER from DCFEBs.
Added test L1A(_MATCH).
DCFEBs are killed by default to avoid hot fibers.

V00-01: 30 May 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
Made the multiplexers to be defaulted to real data, DCFEBs, and LVMB.

V00-00: 28 May 2013, Manuel
--------------------------------
Functionalities implemented and tested:
- Real DCFEB data sent to PC (tested) and DDU (being tested).
- Control of DCFEBs via JTAG.
- Control of the LVMB.
